In this SQL, I'm querying data from Spotify's top 50 songs in 2021 downloaded from Kaggle.

#1. Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then, for every artist with an 
average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH avg_pop_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag
FROM avg_pop_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90;

#2. Who are the top 5 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name, MAX(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY MAX(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 5;

#3. Which artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY MAX(duration_ms) DESC
LIMIT 1;

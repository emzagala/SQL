In this SQL, I'm querying data from Spotify's top 50 songs in 2021 downloaded from Kaggle.

#1. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name, MAX(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY MAX(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2. What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY MAX(duration_ms) DESC
LIMIT 1;

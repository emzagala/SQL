In this SQL code, I'm querying data from a student grades database.

SELECT name, number_grade, ROUND (fraction_completed*100) AS percent_completed 
FROM student_grades;

SELECT COUNT(*),
    CASE
        WHEN number_grade > 90 THEN "A"
        WHEN number_grade > 80 THEN "B"
        WHEN number_grade > 70 THEN "C"
        ELSE "F"
    END as "letter_grade" 
FROM student_grades
GROUP BY "letter_grade";

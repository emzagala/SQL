In this SQL code, I'm using a Common Table Expression (CTE) and a Windows function to query city bike lane data.

#1. Find the average safety rating for all bike lanes in the city, then show the lanes that 
have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher, and add a label that says "Safe Lane".

WITH safety_average_cte AS (
SELECT street, AVG(safetyrating) AS 'rating'
FROM CityBikeLanes
GROUP BY street
)
SELECT street, rating, 'Safe Lane' AS label
FROM safety_average_cte
WHERE rating >= 4;

#2. List of all the bike lanes, both safety ratings for each lane given by the two technicians, 
the average safety rating for each lane, and a label with the following recommendations:

- Label lanes with an average safety rating of 4 or more as "Leave As-Is".
- Label lanes with an average safety rating of less than 2.5 as "Remove".
- All other lanes should be labeled as "Improvements Needed".

SELECT street, safetyrating,
AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) AS "Average_safety_rating_",
CASE
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >= 4 THEN "Leave-As-Is"
    WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) < 2.5 THEN "Remove"
    ELSE "Improvements Needed"
END AS "Recommendation"
FROM CityBikeLanes;

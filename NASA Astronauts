In this SQL code, I'm querying NASA astronauts data.

SELECT COUNT(Space_Walks) AS Women_in_space
FROM astronauts 
WHERE Gender = 'Female';

SELECT AVG(Space_Flight_hr) AS Average_Time_in_space 
FROM astronauts;

SELECT * FROM astronauts 
WHERE Military_Rank = 'Colonel' 
GROUP BY Alma_Mater;

SELECT Name, Military_Branch, Death_Mission 
FROM astronauts 
WHERE Space_Flight_hr > 10 AND Death_Mission NOT NULL 
GROUP BY Military_Branch 
ORDER BY Death_Mission;

SELECT Name, Space_Walks 
FROM astronauts 
GROUP BY Name 
HAVING Space_Walks > 6;
